(unfortunately for AlexNet and CNN , we had difficulties moving it to one drive due to its large size - 12GB and 42 gB , thus it could only be accessed from the gpu cluster where we trained it - however if unable to access GPU cluster , the tester codes to prove reproducibility has been run already , we are sorry for that!)
